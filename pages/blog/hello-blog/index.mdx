# Hello, ~~_world_!~~ blog!

---
<br />

Thanks so much for visiting my little corner of the internet. This blog will
be dedicated to documenting some of my thoughts about development, life, and
all things in between. My hope is to share things in the field of web
development I find especially interesting and detail some of the personal
struggles of someone trying to find their first professional job in the
field. This is the first blog I will be managing myself, and will do my best
to keep myself accountable for keeping it updated regularly.

I'm hoping that documenting my thoughts and ideas about things will
ultimately prove to be a healthy endeavor for me and perhaps encourage
others to do the same. Until next time, I look forward to this new journey
and hope you all will join me for the ride!

See you soon,

-Andrew
